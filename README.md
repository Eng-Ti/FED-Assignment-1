1. What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?

    Node.js a JavaScript shell is used to run JavaScript outside the browser.

2. Name 5 things Javascript can do.

   i. JavaScript is used  to develop web pages to enable interaction between the users and 
      the website. Since Js allows creating dynamic, interactive, user-friendly websites.

   ii. JavaScript is used for creating web applications.

   iii. JavaScript is used to build web servers.

   iv. JavaScript is used to develop server applications i.e. back end infrastructure.

   v. JavaScript is also used to build Real-time Networking Applications like chats.

3. When was ECMAScript first released ?

    According to codeacademy.org ; 
    In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which set the standard for the first version ECMAScript.

   ii. Right click on an empty area and select inspect.
   
   iii.This option opens up chrome developer tools. Here, select the console tab.

5. List the tech fields that use JavaScript, for example FrontEnd.

   i. Back End Development
   
   ii. Web Application Development
   
   iii. Game Development
    
   iv. Mobile Application Development

6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

   Static and Dynamic typing defines how a language expects you to declare data types.
   Static typing, as is found in languages like Java, C, C++ and Go requires explicit
   definition of a data type when they create a piece of data (e.g. variable, parameter, 
   return value) i.e. the type checking process occurs at compile time. As such, these 
   checks will catch things like missing functions, invalid type arguments or a mismatch 
   between a data value and type of variable it's assigned to before the program even has
   a chance to run the erroneous code and risk crashing.

   On the other hand, Dynamic-typed languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP and Perl are
   the opposite of Static-typed languages and can infer, or at least try to guess, the 
   type that you’re using. Type-checking happens at runtime. Instead of halting operations, 
   the compiler will ignore things like invalid type arguments or mismatched data - instead, 
   type checking will occur regularly during runtime. If the type checker detects an error, 
   it will alert the developer and give them an opportunity to correct the code before the program crashes.

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

   The null value denotes nothingness. It denotes something that does not exist. 
   A variable in JavaScript that has a null value is of the 'object' datatype. 
   For example;

   var x = null;                    has a value which is null and type is 'object'

   An undefined datatype denotes an absence of a meaningful value, in JavaScript a variable 
   that is without any value has a value of undefined. The datatype of a variable that holds 
   an undefined value is also 'undefined'. 
   For example;
   
   var x;                    has a value which is 'undefined' and type is 'undefined'.
   
   According to study.com, Although undefined and null are both valid values in JavaScript, for 
   most practical purposes, they denote empty values and carry no information. You can treat them as
   interchangeable for most of the times when you encounter them. JavaScript treats both of these 
   values as equivalent to each other but treats their datatypes as different, for instance;
   
   null == undefined                    // Evaluates to true
